# Power load prediction

Puget Sound Power & Light Co. are looking for a solution to predict the power
load 24 hours in advance, at 8 in the morning, when the current day is a working
day and tomorrow is also a working day. To solve the problem the company
have provided observations for the period January 1985 to October 1990, in-
cluding all seasons. To test the system the company have withheld data from
the winter months, November - March of 1990/1991 and 1991/1992, the output
is not included in the testing data set.

Standard linear regression, linear ridge regression, nearest neighbor, multi-
layer perceptron and a committee of 10 different multilayer perceptron will be
constructed and evaluated.
The models will be made with Python 3 with scikit-learn library through
Jupyter IDE and Github as version control.
